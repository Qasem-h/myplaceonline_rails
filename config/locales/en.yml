# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        # Frequently Asked Questions
        
        ## <a name="theory"></a>What is the theory of the categories?
        
        > ‘Happiness’ is too worn and too weary a term to be of much scientific use, and the discipline of Positive Psychology divides it into three very different realms, each of which is measurable and, most importantly, each of which is skill-based and can be taught (Seligman, 2002). The first is hedonic: positive emotion (joy, love, contentment, pleasure etc.). A life led around having as much of this good stuff as possible, is the ‘Pleasant Life’. The second, much closer to what Thomas Jefferson and Aristotle sought, is the state of flow, and a life led around it is the ‘Engaged Life’. Flow, a major part of the Engaged Life, consists in a loss of self-consciousness, time stopping for you, being ‘one with the music’ (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Importantly engagement seems to be the opposite of positive emotion: when one is totally absorbed, no thoughts or feelings are present—even though one says afterwards ‘that was fun’ (Delle Fave & Massimini, 2005). And while there are shortcuts to positive emotion—you can take drugs, masturbate, watch television, or go shopping—there are no shortcuts to flow. Flow only occurs when you deploy your highest strengths and talents to meet the challenges that come your way, and it is clear that flow facilitates learning. The third realm in the framework of Positive Psychology is the one with the best intellectual provenance, the Meaningful Life. Flow and positive emotion can be found in solipsistic pursuits, but not meaning or purpose. Meaning is increased through our connections to others, future generations, or causes that transcend the self (Durkheim, 1951/1897; Erikson, 1963). From a Positive Psychology perspective, meaning consists in knowing what your highest strengths are, and then using them to belong to and serve something you believe is larger than the self (Seligman, 2002).

        ## How is data encrypted when stored in the database or in offline browser storage?

        Symmetric [AES-256-CBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and a [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)+HMAC+SHA1 key derivation function with an 8 byte salt and 65536 iterations.
        
        ## How is data encrypted when exported to JSON?

        Symmetric [AES-256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and an [S2K](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880)+SHA512 key derivation function with an 8 byte salt and 65536 iterations.
        
        ## Why isn't encryption enabled by default?
        
        If you choose to encrypt certain values, we encrypt them with your password using a [symmetric cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm). This means that if you forget your password, you will not be able to recover those encrypted values (because only you had the key). The "forgot my password" function on websites simply resets your password to a new password after you click a link in an email. There is no such thing as a "forgot my password" function for symmetric encryption. For these reasons, we don't encrypt by default as many users might not understand these risks right away.
        
        ## How are website passwords managed?
        
        We never store your website password. A bcrypt [hash and salt](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet) for the password is stored and used to authenticate you. However, we do store your password in server memory temporarily for the life of your HTTP session. This is needed because your password is used to decrypt any values you chose to encrypt, and asking you for your password every time something needs to be decrypted would be annoying.
        
        When you change your password, we symmetrically decrypt all encrypted values and then re-encrypt them with the new password. This can take a long time if you have a lot of encrypted values.
